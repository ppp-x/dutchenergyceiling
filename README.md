Dutch Energy Ceiling: Calculate your energy bill based on your power consumption. Some energy companies in the Netherlands still show their market price in their app, making them unreliable to get proper insight in how much money you're spending on your energy (yes, I'm looking at you, Eneco!). With this PWA, you can enter the amount of energy you are consuming daily (or script it if you have a Pi connected to your smart meter) and it will calculate how much you're really spending on power based on the energy prices as set by the government.
