Dutch Energy Ceiling: Calculate your energy bill based on your power consumption. With this PWA, you can enter the amount of energy you are consuming daily (or script it if you have a Pi connected to your smart meter) and it will calculate how much you're really spending on power based on the energy prices as set by the government.
