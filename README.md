Dutch Energy Ceiling: Calculate your energy bill based on your power consumption. Some energy companies in the Netherlands still show their market price in their app, making them unreliable to get proper insight in how much money you're spending on your energy (yes, I'm looking at you, Eneco!). With this PWA, you can enter the amount of energy you are consuming daily (or script it if you have a Pi connected to your smart meter) and it will calculate how much you're really spending on power based on the energy prices as set by the government.

Upload this file to any webhost that supports PHP. A free webhost will do, this script does not use SQL so any free webhost that at least supports PHP is sufficient.

This script is loosely forked from Siteswitch: https://www.puckbarton.nl/siteswitch/ (basically, it just is Siteswitch but heavily stripped down and with the calculations added that calculates how much money you've spent on energy).

It's a super simple script, but sometimes a simple script is all you need :)
